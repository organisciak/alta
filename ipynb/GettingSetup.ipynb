The easiest and recommended option is to [download and install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), which is a freely available bundle that includes Python, Jupyter, and several very other things that will be useful to us. It's *very important* for the purposes of our notebooks to select a version for your operating system titled **Python 3.x** (not Python 2.x).\n",

We probably don't want to create Jupyter notebooks there, so we'll navigate to another directory (like \"Documents\") and create a new folder (like \"Notebooks\"). The location and names aren't important but we'll need to remember where our notebooks are for future use."
